            <p>
                Young Life is a group of caring adults who go where kids are, win the right
                to be heard and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vision began in the early 1930s when an elderly woman, Clara Frasher,
                recruited a group of her friends to pray for the teenagers attending Gainesville
                High School in Texas. Six years later, during the spring of 1939, a young 
                seminarian, Jim Rayburn, started a chapter of the Miracle Book Club in Gainesville,
                Texas, a small town 75 miles to the north of Dallas. As he was developing 
                the program in Gainesville, Rayburn also worked with a local pastor, Clyde
                Kennedy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like Clara Frasher and her prayer circle, Kennedy was concerned about the town’s
                teenagers, who showed no interest in engaging with traditional church programs.
                Realizing something must be done, Kennedy hired Rayburn to fill a part-time 
                position within the church in order to accomplish something vital beyond its 
                walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                After exploring several possibilities, Jim decided that the best setting for the 
                proclamation of the Gospel was at a Young Life club, held in the home of one of 
                the kids. Club involved lively singing, a skit and a short talk about Jesus Christ.
                Jim believed that every kid had the right to hear the message of Jesus Christ 
                and decide how to respond to the Gospel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Young people who made the decision to follow Christ became involved in “Campaigners,” 
                a discipleship group where they participated in Bible study, prayer and sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 1944, Add Sewell, one of the first five staff members, discovered the key to 
                going deep with kids: spending time with them on their turf. Add spent hours each 
                week with kids, developing a relational style of outreach. Convinced that he had 
                to win the right to be heard, he simply made friends with them. This approach eventually 
                became known as “contact work,” and it’s been at the heart of Young Life’s mission
                ever since.

                Over the years, Jim gathered a group of gifted men and women around him and sent them 
                out to start Young Life ministries to kids all over the United States. This was the Young 
                Life staff.

                Volunteer leadership — the backbone of Young Life — emerged from Wheaton College in
                the late 1940s. Staff persons found that they could multiply their efforts many times 
                over by the strategic use of volunteer leaders. Today, more than 39,000 volunteer leaders 
                work alongside staff persons to touch the lives of kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1950, Portland staff person Bill Starr developed a novel concept: the Young Life 
                committee. This group of men and women lent their support to the local ministry. 
                Today, committee and ministry support team members around the country number more 
                than 18,000.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1953, Young Life went international with an outreach in France. Since then, 
                incarnational evangelism has proven successful worldwide; Young Life ministries 
                are now active in over 100 countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beginning in the mid-1950s, Young Life broadened its focus to become a nurturing 
                and healing presence for kids of all races; our multiethnic ministries share Christ
                as well as meet the unique needs of these kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recognizing the need for quality training programs for staff, Young Life joined 
                with Fuller Theological Seminary in 1977 to establish the Institute of Youth Ministries. 
                This association provided a unique blend of graduate-level theological education and 
                practical field experience for many years. The institute has now been replaced by expanded 
                partnerships with several seminaries around the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the late 1980s Young Life expanded its focus to include kids with special needs. 
                Young Life ministries with kids with disabilities are in place in many areas of the country,
                allowing these kids to find their boundaries expanded, their lives enriched and their 
                hearts warmed by the love of Jesus. We call this ministry, “Young Life Capernaum.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Doors of ministry to yet another group of kids — teenage moms — opened with the 
                beginning of the YoungLives program. Young moms are matched with older experienced 
                moms who are committed to providing support and friendship as well as the opportunity
                to consider the possibility of a relationship with Jesus Christ. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the Young Life mission is still committed to incarnational witness: 
                embodying and expressing the love of Christ through relationships with all kinds of kids:​
                WyldLife​ is our outreach to middle school kids, Young Life for those in their high school 
                years, and Young Life College is our program for college and university students. 
                In addition to the ministries mentioned above, Young Life reaches military teens through 
                a program called Club Beyond, the Small Towns/Rural initiative brings Young Life to 
                communities of fewer than 25,000 people, and Amicus is Young Life’s student exchange and 
                hosting program for international kids.
            </p>
            <p>
                Young Life… our history is rich and our future is promising. We are a group of 
                adults who continue to be committed to the historic Young Life mission: befriending kids 
                and allowing them to take a good look at the Savior, Jesus Christ.

            <header id="intro_header">Capernaum — Teens and Young Adults with Disabilities</header>
            <p>
                Young Life leaders have the privilege of knowing and sharing their lives with 
                teenagers and young adults with disabilities. While all Young Life activities 
                are open to every high school student, many Young Life areas have dedicated 
                programs for students and young adults with disabilities, typically referred to 
                as Young Life Capernaum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Young Life Capernaum gives young people with intellectual and developmental
                 disabilities the chance to experience fun and adventure, to develop 
                 fulfilling friendships and to challenge their limits while building 
                 self-esteem through club, camp and other exciting activities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Mark 2, the Bible records the story of four able-bodied men and their 
                friend with a disability. Eager for their friend to see Jesus, the talk of 
                the town in Capernaum (kuh-per-ney-uhm), the men carried him on a mat to a 
                home where Jesus was teaching. When the friends arrived, crowds already there 
                prevented the men from getting their friend anywhere close to Jesus. Undaunted, 
                they carried him to the roof where they cut a hole through layers of straw and 
                hardened mud, and lowered the man to Jesus’ feet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moved by their bold faith, Jesus restored the man with a disability to wholeness 
                and health. The lives of all five men — and the crowd who witnessed the event — 
                were never the same. We call Young Life’s ministry with adolescents with 
                disabilities “Capernaum,” because we don’t think intellectual or developmental 
                limitations should keep an adolescent from the presence of the One who promises 
                fullness of life. Like the friends in the story, we move through barriers, including 
                the isolation and marginalization that can accompany having special needs, believing 
                that the lives of teens with disabilities, as well as their able-bodied friends, are 
                transformed by the shared experience of Young Life.

            <p>
                More than 20 years ago, Young Life answered God’s call to run headfirst into the 
                chaos of teenage motherhood with the hope of Jesus ... and YoungLives was born.
            </p>
            <p>
                YoungLives has never wavered from the original vision to reach teen moms by entering
                 their world, modeling the unconditional love of Christ, and encouraging them to 
                 become the women and mothers God created them to be. Through Young Life’s time-tested
                methods and life-on-life mentoring, teen moms are empowered to make positive choices,
                set and achieve goals, and live a future rooted in Christ.

            <header id="intro_header">WyldLife — Middle School</header>
            <p>
                In WyldLife, we love middle school kids! They are full of life and yet experiencing 
                profound emotional and physical changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Middle school is a time when kids make important decisions about who they are and 
                what they believe. And so WyldLife leaders seek to model and express God's love to our 
                young friends by learning their names, hearing their stories and honoring their God-given
                desire for a life of fun, adventure and purpose.

            <p>
                Young Life began in the early 1940s in response to an emerging adolescent 
                subculture, the center of which was the world of the high school.
            </p>
            <p>
                Young Life is in the world of high school — learning kids’ names, hearing their 
                stories, having fun and sharing with them the great news of a God who loves them.
